FASTstack | Functions, APIs, Storage, Tests


@@description
The next generation of sites, apps, and APIs are being built by unlocking an entirely new set of capabilities for developers that showcase the superpowers of web apps.

@@intro
Static sites were only the beginning. The FASTstack unlocks an entirely new set of capabilities for developers, while staying true to the hallmarks of the modern web: maintainability, scalability, and a great developer experience.
<br/><br/>
FASTstack apps have all the speed and cost advantages of statically-rendered sites, but enable the full power of the world's most ubiquitous platformâ€“without the immense complexity.

What the FASTstack is

@@whatIsFASTstack
The FASTstack is a technology and language-agnostic approach to building modern, full-featured web apps, sites, and APIs. It empowers individuals and teams of all sizes to rapidly prototype, ship, and scale their apps in a secure, reproducible way.
<br/><br/>
The FASTstack also provides a clear path to growing an app's capabilities. Delivering the most sophisticated functionality to your customers should never come at the cost of a total rewrite and major architecture change.


@@functionsHeader
Functions

@@functions
Augment client-side programming with secure, trusted logic running in isolated, scalable cloud functions (like AWS Lambda or Azure Functions). Use nearly any framework, library, or language (including JavaScript, TypeScript, Python, Ruby, Go, Rust, and Java) without ever having to manage servers.


@@APIsHeader
APIs

@@APIs
Requests + responses are marshaled via reusable endpoints that deliver pre-rendered or dynamically generated markup, WebSockets, static assets, and JSON via REST or GraphQL. They may also interface with third-party servers.


@@storageHeader
Storage

@@storage
Durably persist and instantly access dynamic data with in-network or distributed out-of-network cloud databases, capable of elastically scaling to meet read/write capacity. Storage may be structured or unstructured data, but may also include blob / static asset ingestion and delivery.


@@testabilityHeader
Tests

@@testability
Rapidly prototype and validate in a local/offline development environment, and extend into automated test suites, enabling continuous integration. Green builds deploy to reproducible, deterministic environments via Infrastructure as Code.
